## A/B Testing Framework

### Overview

The integrated A/B testing framework allows you to run experiments on any part of your application to optimize user experience and business metrics. The framework is lightweight, type-safe, and designed specifically for React applications.

### Key Features

- **Client-side experiment assignment** with consistent user bucketing
- **Persistent assignments** across sessions using localStorage
- **Real-time conversion tracking** and analytics
- **Admin dashboard** for managing experiments
- **Type-safe API** with full TypeScript support
- **Flexible configuration** for any UI element or user experience

### Framework Architecture

```typescript
// Core Components:
- ExperimentProvider: React Context provider for experiment state
- useExperiment: Hook for accessing experiment variants in components
- ExperimentManager: Admin UI for managing experiments
- Types: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
```

### How to Use A/B Testing

#### 1. Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { useExperiment } from '@/hooks/useExperiment';

function MyComponent() {
  const experiment = useExperiment('button-color-test', 'click');
  
  const buttonColor = experiment.variant === 'red' 
    ? 'bg-red-500' 
    : 'bg-blue-500';
  
  return (
    <button 
      className={buttonColor}
      onClick={() => experiment.trackConversion()}
    >
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Configuration-based Testing

```tsx
function ProductCard() {
  const experiment = useExperiment('product-layout');
  
  return (
    <div className={experiment.config.layoutClass || 'grid'}>
      <h3 className={experiment.config.titleSize || 'text-lg'}>
        Product Name
      </h3>
      {/* Component renders based on experiment config */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Advanced Conversion Tracking

```tsx
function CheckoutFlow() {
  const experiment = useExperiment('checkout-flow');
  
  const handlePurchase = (amount: number) => {
    // Track conversion with custom value
    experiment.trackConversion('purchase', amount);
    
    // Track secondary metrics
    experiment.trackConversion('checkout_completion');
  };
}
```

### Creating New Experiments

Add experiments to `src/data/experimentsData.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'my-new-experiment',
  name: 'My New Experiment',
  description: 'Testing feature X vs feature Y',
  status: 'active',
  variants: [
    {
      id: 'control',
      name: 'Original',
      weight: 50,
      config: { /* variant configuration */ }
    },
    {
      id: 'variant-a',
      name: 'New Version',
      weight: 50,
      config: { /* variant configuration */ }
    }
  ],
  metrics: {
    primary: 'conversion',
    secondary: ['engagement', 'time_on_page']
  }
}
```

### Experiment Management

Access the A/B test manager at `/admin/experiments` to:
- View all active and draft experiments
- See your current variant assignments
- Monitor conversion tracking results
- Start, pause, or stop experiments
- Analyze experiment performance

### Data Storage

- **Assignments**: Stored in localStorage for persistence
- **Results**: Stored locally (easily extensible to external analytics)
- **Experiments**: Configured in code for version control

### Integration Examples

The framework is already integrated into:

1. **Landing Page CTA Button** (`/`)
   - Tests different button colors and text
   - Tracks CTA click conversions

2. **Admin Navigation** (`/admin`)
   - Tests expanded vs collapsed sidebar
   - Tracks navigation efficiency

3. **Chart Visualizations**
   - Tests different chart types
   - Tracks user interaction patterns

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple UI changes (colors, text, layouts)
2. **Clear Metrics**: Define primary and secondary metrics before starting
3. **Statistical Significance**: Run experiments long enough for meaningful results
4. **User Segments**: Consider different user behaviors and segments
5. **Performance**: Monitor that experiments don't impact app performance

### Extending the Framework

To add new features:

1. **Custom Targeting**: Extend `targetingRules` in experiment configuration
2. **External Analytics**: Replace localStorage with your analytics provider
3. **Server-side Assignment**: Implement server-side experiment assignment
4. **Advanced Statistics**: Add statistical significance calculations
5. **Experiment Scheduling**: Add automatic start/stop functionality
